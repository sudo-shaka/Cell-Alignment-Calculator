# Cell-Alignment-Calculator
Used to get the shapes of cells in a monolayer with nuclear and junctional protein stains. It then determines the cell axis ratio (alignment), perimeter, cell area, nuclear position, center of mass, and the polarity of a given signal.

It requires a nuclear stain and a junctional stain to use. Hand drawn cell boarders can also be used as input. 

Python code follows development of matlab code, so typically the matlab code is more up-to-date and has better functionality.
