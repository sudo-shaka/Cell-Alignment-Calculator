# Cell-Alignment-Calculator
Work in progress. Used to get the shapes of cells in a mono-layer with nuclear and junctional protein stains. It then determines the cell axis ratio (alignment) as well as cell area. Handing of gaps in junctions needs to be improved. Matlab code works best and is most up-to-date.
