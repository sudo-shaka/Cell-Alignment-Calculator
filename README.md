# Cell-Alignment-Calculator
Used to get the shapes of cells in a mono-layer with nuclear and junctional protein stains. It then determines the cell axis ratio (alignment), perimeter, cell area, and the polarity of a given signal.

It requires a nuclear stain and a junctional stain to use. Hand drawn cell boarders can also be used as input.
